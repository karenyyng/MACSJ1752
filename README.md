# Coding standards 
I follow the the testing standards from AstroPy and use `py.test`. 
And please follow the Python coding style guide [`PEP8`](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
If you do not know what `PEP8` is, run your code through
[`autoPEP8`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8/1.1) before pushing your
code.
