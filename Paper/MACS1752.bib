abstract = {We report the discovery of large-scale diffuse radio emission in the galaxy cluster MACS J1752.0+4440 (z= 0.366). Using Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) observations we find that the cluster hosts a double radio relic system as well as a 1.65 Mpc radio halo covering the region between the two relics. The relics are diametrically located on opposite sides of the cluster centre. The NE and SW relics have sizes of 1.3 and 0.9 Mpc, respectively. In the case of an isolated binary merger event, the relative sizes of the relics suggest a mass ratio about 2:1. We measure integrated spectra of -1.16 ± 0.03 for the NE relic and -1.10 ± 0.05 for the SW relic. We conclude that this cluster has undergone a violent binary merger event and the relics are best explained by particles (re)accelerated in outwards travelling shock waves. The spectral indices suggest that the relics trace shock waves with Mach numbers (?) of around 3.5-4.5. These relatively high Mach numbers derived from the radio spectral index are comparable to those derived for a few other recently discovered relics. This implies that merger shocks with ? are relatively common in cluster outskirts if our understanding of diffusive shock acceleration is correct.},

@article{Schlafly2010,
abstract = {We present measurements of dust reddening using the colors of stars with spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We measure reddening as the difference between the measured and predicted colors of a star, as derived from stellar parameters from the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline. We achieve uncertainties of 54, 34, 25, and 28 mmag in the colors u-g, g-r, r-i, and i-z, per star, though the uncertainty varies depending on the stellar type and the magnitude of the star. The spectrum-based reddening measurements confirm our earlier "blue tip" reddening measurements (Schlafly 2010), finding reddening coefficients different by -4\%, 2\%, 1\%, and 2\% in u-g, g-r, r-i, and i-z from those found by the blue tip method, after accounting for a small 4\% normalization effect plausibly caused by the different sky footprint available for this analysis. These results prefer an R\_V=3.1 Fitzpatrick (1999) reddening law to O'Donnell (1994) or Cardelli (1989) reddening laws. We provide a table of conversion coefficients from the Schlegel et al. (1998, SFD) maps of E(B-V) to extinction in 88 bandpasses for 4 values of R\_V using this reddening law. These coefficients supersede those in SFD and amount to a recalibration of SFD.},

@article{Jee2013,
abstract = {We present a cosmic shear study from the Deep Lens Survey (DLS), a deep BVRz multi-band imaging survey of five 4 deg2 fields with two National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO) 4 m telescopes at Kitt Peak and Cerro Tololo. For both telescopes, the change of the point-spread-function (PSF) shape across the focal plane is complicated, and the exposure-to-exposure variation of this position-dependent PSF change is significant. We overcome this challenge by modeling the PSF separately for individual exposures and CCDs with principal component analysis (PCA). We find that stacking these PSFs reproduces the final PSF pattern on the mosaic image with high fidelity, and the method successfully separates PSF-induced systematics from gravitational lensing effects. We calibrate our shears and estimate the errors, utilizing an image simulator, which generates sheared ground-based galaxy images from deep Hubble Space Telescope archival data with a realistic atmospheric turbulence model. For cosmological parameter constraints, we marginalize over shear calibration error, photometric redshift uncertainty, and the Hubble constant. We use cosmology-dependent covariances for the Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis and find that the role of this varying covariance is critical in our parameter estimation. Our current non-tomographic analysis alone constrains the $\Omega$ M -$\sigma$8 likelihood contour tightly, providing a joint constraint of $\Omega$ M = 0.262 ± 0.051 and $\sigma$8 = 0.868 ± 0.071. We expect that a future DLS weak-lensing tomographic study will further tighten these constraints because explicit treatment of the redshift dependence of cosmic shear more efficiently breaks the $\Omega$ M -$\sigma$8 degeneracy. Combining the current results with the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 7 year (WMAP7) likelihood data, we obtain $\Omega$ M = 0.278 ± 0.018 and $\sigma$8 = 0.815 ± 0.020.},
