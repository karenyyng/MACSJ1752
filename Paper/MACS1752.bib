abstract = {We present accurate photometric redshifts in the 2-deg2 COSMOS field. The redshifts are computed with 30 broad, intermediate, and narrow bands covering the UV (GALEX), Visible-NIR (Subaru, CFHT, UKIRT and NOAO) and mid-IR (Spitzer/IRAC). A chi2 template-fitting method (Le Phare) was used and calibrated with large spectroscopic samples from VLT-VIMOS and Keck-DEIMOS. We develop and implement a new method which accounts for the contributions from emission lines (OII, Hbeta, Halpha and Ly) to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The treatment of emission lines improves the photo-z accuracy by a factor of 2.5. Comparison of the derived photo-z with 4148 spectroscopic redshifts (i.e. Delta z = zs - zp) indicates a dispersion of sigma\_\{Delta z/(1+zs)\}=0.007 at i<22.5, a factor of 2-6 times more accurate than earlier photo-z in the COSMOS, CFHTLS and COMBO-17 survey fields. At fainter magnitudes i<24 and z<1.25, the accuracy is sigma\_\{Delta z/(1+zs)\}=0.012. The deep NIR and IRAC coverage enables the photo-z to be extended to z\~{}2 albeit with a lower accuracy (sigma\_\{Delta z/(1+zs)\}=0.06 at i\~{}24). The redshift distribution of large magnitude-selected samples is derived and the median redshift is found to range from z=0.66 at 22<i<22.5 to z=1.06 at 24.5<i<25. At i<26.0, the multi-wavelength COSMOS catalog includes approximately 607,617 objects. The COSMOS-30 photo-z enable the full exploitation of this survey for studies of galaxy and large scale structure evolution at high redshift.},

@article{Schlafly2010,
abstract = {We present measurements of dust reddening using the colors of stars with spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We measure reddening as the difference between the measured and predicted colors of a star, as derived from stellar parameters from the SEGUE Stellar Parameter Pipeline. We achieve uncertainties of 54, 34, 25, and 28 mmag in the colors u-g, g-r, r-i, and i-z, per star, though the uncertainty varies depending on the stellar type and the magnitude of the star. The spectrum-based reddening measurements confirm our earlier "blue tip" reddening measurements (Schlafly 2010), finding reddening coefficients different by -4\%, 2\%, 1\%, and 2\% in u-g, g-r, r-i, and i-z from those found by the blue tip method, after accounting for a small 4\% normalization effect plausibly caused by the different sky footprint available for this analysis. These results prefer an R\_V=3.1 Fitzpatrick (1999) reddening law to O'Donnell (1994) or Cardelli (1989) reddening laws. We provide a table of conversion coefficients from the Schlegel et al. (1998, SFD) maps of E(B-V) to extinction in 88 bandpasses for 4 values of R\_V using this reddening law. These coefficients supersede those in SFD and amount to a recalibration of SFD.},

@misc{VanWeeren2012,
abstract = {We report the discovery of large-scale diffuse radio emission in the galaxy cluster MACS J1752.0+4440 (z= 0.366). Using Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) observations we find that the cluster hosts a double radio relic system as well as a 1.65 Mpc radio halo covering the region between the two relics. The relics are diametrically located on opposite sides of the cluster centre. The NE and SW relics have sizes of 1.3 and 0.9 Mpc, respectively. In the case of an isolated binary merger event, the relative sizes of the relics suggest a mass ratio about 2:1. We measure integrated spectra of -1.16 ± 0.03 for the NE relic and -1.10 ± 0.05 for the SW relic. We conclude that this cluster has undergone a violent binary merger event and the relics are best explained by particles (re)accelerated in outwards travelling shock waves. The spectral indices suggest that the relics trace shock waves with Mach numbers (?) of around 3.5-4.5. These relatively high Mach numbers derived from the radio spectral index are comparable to those derived for a few other recently discovered relics. This implies that merger shocks with ? are relatively common in cluster outskirts if our understanding of diffusive shock acceleration is correct.},
